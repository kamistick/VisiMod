# VisiMod
The VisiMod package was built to facilitate visibility analyses. Relying on the terra() and ranger() packges, it provides functions to model visibility across any landscape for which a digital terrain model (dtm) and digital surface model (dsm) exists. 

[Mistick et. al 2023](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2023.2224421) describes the methodology on which this package is based.
